I am an economist pursuing an MSc degree at [University of Brasilia (UnB)](https://unb.br). My research interests include Macroeconomics, Urban & Labor Economics and Public Policy. 

I am currently a Research Assistant at [IPEA](https://www.ipea.gov.br/portal/), working on urban accessibility and mobility inequality in Brazil at the [Access to Opportunities Project](https://www.ipea.gov.br/acessooportunidades/en/).

Moreover, I am the host of the [Ceteris Paribus](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8yNmMyMjIwNC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw?ved=0CBgQ7dUFahcKEwj45dy_kqzqAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ/), a podcast about economics and history. Also, I am an amateur marathoner and triathlete, and [#RStats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?lang=en) enthusiast."
